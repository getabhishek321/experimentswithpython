## Project Overview

You’ll build a small, interactive Python program where:

1. The user can **see available toppings** (with prices).
2. They can **enter one or multiple toppings** (comma-separated).
3. The program will:

   * Check which toppings are **available** and which are not.
   * Calculate the **total cost** for the valid ones.
   * Display a **summary or receipt**.

---

## Step-by-Step Plan

### **Step 1 — Define your data**

*Hint:*
Instead of having two lists, use a **dictionary** to map toppings to prices.

Example structure (don’t copy-paste yet — just understand):

```python
toppings = {'cheese': 20, 'pepper': 10, ...}
```

**Goal:** Be able to access the price of any topping easily using `toppings[name]`.

---

### **Step 2 — Show available toppings**

*Hint:*
Use a simple `for` loop to print all toppings with prices, one per line.

**Goal:** Output like

```
Available toppings:
cheese - $20
pepper - $10
...
```

---

### **Step 3 — Get user input**

*Hint:*
Use `input()` to get multiple toppings from the user, separated by commas.
Then split that string using `.split(',')`.

**Goal:**
User types:

```
cheese, pepper, pineapple
```

And your program turns that into a **list** like:

```python
['cheese', 'pepper', 'pineapple']
```

*Bonus hint:* Use `.strip()` to remove spaces around each item after splitting.

---

### **Step 4 — Validate and calculate**

*Hint:*
Iterate through each user topping:

* If it’s in your toppings dictionary → add its price to a running total.
* Else → inform the user that it’s not available.

**Goal:**
You’ll have:

* A variable like `total = 0`
* Add prices using `total += toppings[item]` for available ones.

---

### **Step 5 — Print the final receipt**

*Hint:*
Once the loop ends, print:

* What toppings were added
* The total cost
* A fun thank-you message 

Example (goal, not code):

```
Your pizza will have cheese, pepper
Total cost: $30
Thanks for ordering from Python Pizza!
```

---

##  Bonus Challenge (Optional)

Once your basic version works, try one of these:

* Allow the user to **add extra cheese or double toppings** (multiplying cost).
* Offer a **discount** if the total crosses a certain amount.
* Add a **“plain pizza”** option if no input is given.
* Ask them if they even need a topping
